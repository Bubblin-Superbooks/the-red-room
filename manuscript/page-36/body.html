You can feel it even in the daytime, even of a bright summer&rsquo;s day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping behind you however you face about. In the dusk it creeps in the corridor and follows you, so that you dare not turn. It is even as you say. Fear itself is in that room. Black Fear.... And there it will be... so long as this house of sin endures.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
