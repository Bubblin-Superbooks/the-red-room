As I did so, the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so as to be closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned and looked at them, and saw they were all close together, dark against the firelight, staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent expression on their ancient faces.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; I said, setting the door open. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own choosing,&rdquo; said the man with the withered arm.</p></div> </div>
